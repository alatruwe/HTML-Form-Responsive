# HTML-Form-Responsive
## Frontend Foundations - 5 HTML Forms

For this drill, you get the opportunity to build a functional email form. From a minimum, you need to create the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- Message

Of course, if you wish to add radio buttons, checkboxes, or a dropdown to include additional information you are welcome to.

The webpage should be hosted on GitHub and published as a GitHub Page so the email form is functional.
